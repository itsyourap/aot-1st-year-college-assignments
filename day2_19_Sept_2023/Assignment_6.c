Assignment 6:-

In a small printing shop nestled on the corner of Elm Street, there lived an old printer named Thomas.
Thomas had been in the business of printing for decades, and he was known far and wide for his
impeccable craftsmanship.

One day, a young author named Lucy walked into Thomas's shop with a special request. She had
just finished writing her debut novel, a heartfelt story of love and adventure, and she needed Thomas's
expertise to bring it to life. But there was one particular challenge - Lucy's story was filled with quotes,
both single and double, that were integral to her narrative.

Thomas accepted the challenge with a twinkle in his eye. He carefully selected his vintage printing
press and began setting the type. With each press of the lever, he skillfully printed Lucy's novel,
ensuring that every single and double quote was meticulously placed.

As the pages rolled off the press, Lucy couldn't help but admire the precision and artistry in
Thomas's work. Her story was coming to life in a way that exceeded her wildest dreams.

When Lucy finally held her printed novel in her hands, she knew it was a masterpiece. Thomas had
captured the essence of her story, with every ' and " carefully printed to convey the emotions and
dialogues. It was a testament to the power of words and the artistry of printing.

From that day forward, Thomas's shop became a haven for writers who cherished the beauty of
quotes. His dedication to his craft and his attention to detail made him a legend in the world of printing.
And for Lucy, her debut novel became not just a story but a work of art, thanks to the skillful placement
of ' and " by the master printer, Thomas.

Now, as Thomas's shop becomes too much famous and Thomas is older enough to handle all the
task, he is finding for an assistant. The only criterion is to print single quote and double quote using C
language. You try to write the program so that you can apply for that job.

Expected Output:
Single Quote: '
Double Quote: "
