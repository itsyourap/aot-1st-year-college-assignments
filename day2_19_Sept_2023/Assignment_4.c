Assignment 4:-

In the heart of a bustling city, there lived a young computer science student named Kate. Kate was
known for her love of creativity and recently started to learn coding. One day, she decided to embark
on a unique project: she wanted to create a pattern using the C language.

Kate envisioned a pattern that would mimic the cityscape outside her window, with buildings rising
and falling like waves. She spent days sketching and planning, visualizing the elegant symphony of
lines and shapes she wanted to bring to life.

With determination, Kate began coding her pattern. When Kate finally executed her program,
unfortunately it didnâ€™t work.

Now, have to help Kate by writing the program using C language.

Expected Output:
A
    c
        a
            d
                e
                    m
                        y
