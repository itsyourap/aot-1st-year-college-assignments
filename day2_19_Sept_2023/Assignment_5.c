Assignment 5:-

In the quiet town of Knowledgeville, there was a renowned educational institution known as the
Knowledge Academy. This esteemed establishment had been at the forefront of education for
decades, shaping the minds of generations.

One fine day, a group of enthusiastic students decided to create a banner to celebrate their
beloved academy's achievements. They wanted to display the name "Academy" in a unique and eyecatching way.
After brainstorming ideas, they decided to put "Academy" in double quotes to emphasize its significance.

With great excitement, the students gathered their art supplies and set to work. They carefully
handcrafted each letter, making them bold and beautiful. Then, they added the finishing touch: double
quotes around the word "Academy."

The banner was a masterpiece, with "Academy" enclosed in double quotes that shone brilliantly
under the sun. It symbolized the value and importance of education, capturing the spirit of the
Knowledge Academy.

The students proudly hung their banner in the town square, and it quickly became a symbol of
pride for Knowledgeville. Passersby would stop to admire the craftsmanship and the message it
conveyed.

The display of "Academy" in double quotes wasn't just a simple decoration; it represented the
collective dedication to learning and the pursuit of knowledge in Knowledgeville. It reminded everyone
that education was a treasure worth cherishing, and the town's academy was at the heart of that
pursuit.

Similarly, to print "Academy" in double quotes is not so much easy. Prove that you also can do such
a great thing by writing a program in C language which will print "Academy".

Expected Output:
"Academy"
