Assignment 3:-

Once upon a time, in a small coding workshop tucked away in a quiet corner of a bustling city, there
lived a young programmer named Lily. Lily had a keen interest in learning different programming
languages and loved taking on coding challenges. One sunny afternoon, she decided to create a
program in the C language that would print a beautiful box on her computer screen.

With her fingers dancing across the keyboard, Lily began writing her C program. She included the
necessary header files and defined the main function. Then, she started to implement her logic for
printing a box.

Now you also have to write such a program but inside the box your college name should also be
printed to impress Lily. And if you use only printf() function, then it will be treated as you are a work
harder boy. 

Expected Output:
***************************
|                         |
|  Academy of Technology  |
|                         |
